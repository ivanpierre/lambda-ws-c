Project evolved a lot and goes in another direction... so documentation is to be completely rewritten...

Define data elements of a language as an AST system. The whole in C.

Somewhere it's like quantum against relativist physics.

Simple elements are complex to use but you can manage them with a simple, short code treatments. They are bricks of this AST system. But the goal is to manage complex compound made of these bricks, worse, you will use the brick behavior to create their behavior. Where is the border between simple and compound objects. When does, the language emerges out of elements that should be able to create any languages.

Perhaps is it an utopy. Perhaps languages are not made of simple bricks, general enough to generate all generalizations. Perhaps, the middle cement that glue all these bricks are between bricks and structures emerging from them.

Desires, knowledge, experience and experiments make from this mold an interesting journey. Retain one's tendency to go in known paths, do not be afraid to test and make errors, in order to discover some others, this is not always an easy way.
