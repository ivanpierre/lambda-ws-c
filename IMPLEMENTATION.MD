```

## Boxing `nodes.c`, `nodes.h`
Every types of AST element have it's own structure. This structure is an implementation detail and can change as 
project evolves. These types are treated, based on the language definition AND on objects needed to the language 
management. Boxing is needed to manage data types as C doesn't do it for us...

All instances of these types are nodes witch will be managed by the allocator.

```c
    /*
        Struct of a base node
    */
    typedef struct Node
    {
        NodeType        type;
        long            occurrences;
    #ifdef DEBUG_ALLOC
        struct Node     *previous_node;
        struct Node     *next_node;
    #endif
        union
        {
            Integer     integer;        // Integer as long
            Decimal     decimal;        // Floats as double
            void        *compl;         // all structs
        } val;
    } Node;

```

- [`nodes.c`](src/lws/nodes.c) : contain allocation and general node management.
- [`nodes.h`](src/lws/nodes.h) : gives all structures of nodes and all public management functions.

Ordering of nodes as keys is defined by the comparison function. witch is different from the equality function.
For example 0 is equal to 0.0, but they can both be keys for maps or sets.

## Collections [`collections.c`](src/lws/collections.c)
All collections are stored in an array. With 

- `size`, giving the prensent number of valid nodes of the collection and 
- `max`, giving the number of allocated nodes.

```c
    /*
        Collection : Array, List, Map and Set
    */
    typedef struct
    {
        bool            mutable;
        long            size;
        long            max;
        struct Node     **nodes;
    } Collection;
```

LIST and ARRAY are ordinated node's sequences. List goes backward growing to the head and arrays upward
growing to the tail. Other collections are ordinated by the key order.

LIST and ARRAY are equals if they share the same structure and the equal values for elements.

### LIST 
This is linked list data type. We need it to implement function calls and definitions.

This contains a first element witch is a node and a next element witch should be a LIST or NULL (for list ending). 
This should ensure that all lists are lists and not conses to enable management of lists as arrays.

### ARRAY
Not needed now, but in fact all collections are arrays.

### MAP
Is needed to define data dictionary and environment for functions and lets. Nodes of a map are KEYVALs.

### SET
Sets are maps where keys and values are the same. So it's an array of nodes ordinated by nodes order as keys.

### SEQ

```c
    typedef struct
    {
        long            index;
        struct Node     *coll;
    } Seq;
```

### KEYVAL
Association of keys and values. The are printed as key, values pair as an array if they are not in a map.

```c
/*
    Key/Values binding
*/
typedef struct
{
    struct Node     *key;
    struct Node     *value;
} KeyValue;

```

## Textual values [`strings.c`](src/lws/strings.c)
These are all stored as strings without decoration say :key is stored as the string 'key' as symbol key and 
string "key". But they are not equals, order is first string order and second type order.

### STRING
Hosts the name of symbols,

## Named values [`named.c`](src/lws/named.c)
These are representation of named values as symbol or keyword

### SYMBOL
To define symbolic names, function names, argument names.

### KEYWORD
To define symbolic constant names. Keywords evaluate to themselves.

## Functions [`function.c`](src/lws/function.c) and [`env.c`](src/lws/env.c)
They keep track of their arity and their eventual closures. They can have a macro-expansion capability (only at 
read/compile time), and an evaluation of args capability.

- `is_macro` defines if the function is for macro expansion.
- `is special` defines if argument are evaluated before execution.
- `closure` the optional closure environment of the function.
- `args` array of arguments in case of vararg an '&' symbol is the penultimate.

```c
    /*
        Functions
    */
    typedef struct
    {
        bool                is_macro;
        bool                is_special;
        struct Node         *closure; // MAP
        struct Node         *args;    // LIST
        union
        {
            struct Node     *(*func) (struct Node *args, ...);
            struct Node     *body;
        } func;
    } Function;
```

### FUNCTION 
To define a call to C functions. These are varargs functions where the function arguments should match the args data.

### LAMBDA
To define LWC functions that should be evaluated under the arguments. Interpreted function.
These are not defined now in the current language definition, but will be used in REPL creation.

### API

### ENV_STACK

### ENVIRONMENT 
Global environment is a mapped collection of symbols with values. If dynamic binding is enabled a dynamic 
environment will stack over it. So there will be two stack, one global on witch every local environment will 
grow, and a local one. Implementation details are still in reflexion...

Calling a function will stack local arguments as a new local stack. Enter in a let block will stack new environment and 
adding bindings. Function creation inner in a local block will keep it's syntactical local environment. Output from 
these blocks will unstack environment.

## Numeric values [`numbers.c`](src/lws/numbers.c)
There is no automatic type enhancement on overflow, but cast to DECIMAL will be done on binary operations with a 
FLOAT value.

### INTEGER
Manage integer values. Implemented as longs

### DECIMAL
Manage floating point values. Implemented as doubles.

## Values management [`atom.c`](src/lws/atom.c)

### VAR

### REF

### FUTURE

### AGENT

## Other elements

### Global [`global.c`](src/clojure/global.c)
Here will be stored the core functions of the LWC language. 

This will manage :

- Interaction function with data structure and manage the dispatching to correct functions.
- Special functions witch doesn't evaluate arguments
- Basic macros... well no...
- These function will be accessible by the language

### Reader [`reader.c`](src/clojure/reader.c)
The reader will read in the current reader file handler to transform character strings into AST structure. This will 
recognize symbols, numbers. Complementary syntax will be managed by a functional indirection through an array linking
character with specific reader function. For example '(' character with list reader or '[' with array reader.
